# roller - streamline kernel management

## Overview

Roller provides a handy Kernel object which simplifies the process of configuring and compiling kernels.

## Notes

* Does not build or install modules (I configure my kernels without modules)
* Expects control of your /boot/grub/menu.lst. It will generate a "correct" (to it) file there if you remove your existing file before the first use of roller

## How to use
