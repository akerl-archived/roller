Roller.py is a tool to automate revising and rolling kernels.

The process is pretty self-explanatory, and it walks you through it with fairly informative dialogs:

1) Choose your kernel version. Currently extracted kernels are listed, and it will try to download and/or extract any other version
2) Select the config to start from. The default is to use your currently loaded configuraton
3) Confirm the new revision number. The default is the next unused number.
4) Enter menuconfig and adjust the kernel however you'd like
5) Confirm if the new revision should be saved
6) Choose whether or not to install the kernel into /boot/ automatically
7) Wait for the kernel to make
8) Choose whether or not to proactively clean the kernel source

The directory structure is laid out like this:
  - archives/ = stored tarballs from kernel.org
  - sources/ = extracted kernel sources
  - configs/ = saved kernel configurations

Some notes:
  - This uses the sh module, so you'll need to have it installed ( https://github.com/amoffat/sh )
  - Modules / initramfs are not built or installed, as I configure my kernels to not use them.
  - When installing kernels, it looks for the first "root (hd$)" and "kernel....root=/dev/blah" lines in your /boot/grub/menu.lst to get those variables.
